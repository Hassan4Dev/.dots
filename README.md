# Dots, kinda

I use Windows, so I can't really have a proper ~/.dots system, but I store my configs here in case my computer ever explodes and I need to set up my new one fast.

## But why Windows

I have to. I use Windows for work, and I tried dual booting but didn't like the hassle of configuring two systems.

## Configs

### VSCode

This is for my theme, keybindings, and settings.json. I should probably publish my theme properly so I don't need to do this, but oh well.

### Powertoys

Keyboard manager (some shortcuts I like), and FancyZones for tiling. One day I'm switch move to Linux and use hyprland - I dream of this day.

### Terminal

Just threw some configs here, not much customization here apart from some colors.
